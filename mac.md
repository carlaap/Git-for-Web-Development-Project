## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch? 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?



1. Git is "an open source program for tracking changes in files"
2. Git is an "open-source tool developers install locally on computers, and GitHub is a cloud or online service that stores code pushed by the Git tool."
3. We create a branch to work "freely without disrupting the main file"
4. The purpose of a pull request are changes submitted to a respiratory by an user and accepted or rejected by other collaborators.
5."git check out"
6.the 'git fetch' command adds changes to your local branch without committing to them, unlike 'git pull' whihc pulls the changes and adds them to your main branch . 'git merge' command takes changes made on one branch and applies them another.
7.  a merge conflict happens when people make changes to the same line or same file 
You can resolve a merge conflict by opening the file and making the necessary changes.
